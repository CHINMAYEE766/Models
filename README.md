Robust License Plate Detection in Low-Light & Blurry Conditions Duration: December 2024 â€“ January 2025 Technologies: PyTorch, CUDA, YOLOv10, MIRNet, DeblurGAN, ESRGAN

Overview This project focuses on developing a GPU-accelerated deep learning pipeline for robust license plate detection under low-light and motion-blur conditions. By integrating a series of enhancement models before detection, we significantly improved object detection accuracy in real-world challenging environments.

Key Features ðŸ”§ End-to-End Pipeline: From image enhancement to license plate detection.

ðŸš€ GPU Acceleration: Leveraged CUDA with PyTorch to optimize performance.

ðŸ“ˆ Improved Detection Accuracy: Enhanced YOLOv10 results using pre-processing techniques.

ðŸ“¸ Real-world Scenarios: Tested on images with poor lighting and motion-induced blur.
